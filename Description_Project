CMPG 223: Systems Analysis and Design ii in 2022 (Our second year)

This project was based on a theoretical problem that we had to create in CMPG 213: System Analysis and Design 1.
This case was more of a transactional problem and needed an effective system to add, update and remove a couple of assets to the company.
Documentation was included about the scenario inside these directories.
